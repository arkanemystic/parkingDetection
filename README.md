# Parking Detection Vision AI using OpenCV

This project utilizes computer vision techniques implemented with OpenCV to detect parking spaces in images or video streams. The goal is to develop an intelligent system capable of identifying vacant and occupied parking spots in real-time.

## Features

- Detection of vacant and occupied parking spaces
- Real-time processing of video streams
- Easily customizable for different parking lot layouts
- Integration with existing surveillance systems

## Customization

The system can be customized for different parking lot layouts and configurations. Modify parameters such as threshold values, contour detection methods, and color spaces in the script to adapt to specific environments.
